coll001,001_peeking.jpeg,,,Peeking,Rebecca Zarrella,2010-06-17,"A close-up photo of three dianthus flowers, with one of the flowers pointing upwards toward the sky and the other two pointing off to the sides. The flower pointing upwards is the main focus of the photo, as it is the flower the viewer can see in the most detail. The dianthus flowers are a combination of pink and purple with white on the ends of slightly-jagged petals, and the colors are a cool tone due to the editing of the photo. The pistil, which is a collection of slender, white stalks, emerges from the center of the flower and curls upward slightly. The background of the photo includes other dianthus flowers, but they are blurry, as the depth of the photo is shallow to focus on the three main flowers that are the subject. A small bit of yellowish light peeks out from the blurry background.",Nature;Plants;Flowers,"Frederick, MD;Frederick, M.D.;Frederick, MD.;Frederick, Maryland",39.3254812,-77.256722,Original,1,Image;Still Image;Photograph,image/jpeg,English,,,Pink;Purple;White,Canon Powershot SD750,Visual;Textual,PaintShop Pro 8,Close-Up,Blurry

Its eight petals are a very light yellow that look almost white, and in the center of the flower are clusters of black and a darker yellow. The petals have a few black spots, indicating that the flower may be aged. The background of the photo is blurry, but the viewer can make out some dark green leaves.
